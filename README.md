This repo contains my completed work for CS 6476 (Computer Vision) for Fall 2025. For each project, I have uploaded my source code, jupyter notebook with results (framework provided by the course), final report, and any additional documents pertaining to my results. I achieved the following scores on each project:

Project 1 (Convolution and Hybrid Images): Code - 55/50, Report - 51.5/50
Project 2 (SIFT Feature Matching and Camera Calibration): Code - 55/50, Report - 52.1/50
Project 3 (Scene Recognition with Deep Learning): Code - 50/50, Report - 45/50
Project 4 (Segmantic Segmentation with PSPnet): Code - 55/50, Report - 51.5/50
Project 5 (Classifying Point Clouds with PointNet): Code - 55/50, Report - 51.25/50
Project 6 (Neural Radiance Fields): Code - 55/50, Report 55/50
